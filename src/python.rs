/// pm-remez is a modern Rust implementation of the Parks-McClellan Remez exchange
/// algorithm. It can be used as a Rust library and as a Python package via its
/// Python bindings.
///
/// pm-remez supports the design of FIR filters with even symmetry and odd symmetry,
/// and with an even number of taps and an odd number of taps, by reducing all
/// these cases to the even symmetry odd number of taps case. The desired frequency
/// response in each band, as well as the weights, can be defined as arbitrary
/// functions. The Python package can use double-precision IEEE 754 floating-point
/// numbers for calculations, as well as the higher precision `num-bigfloat`_
/// library. This can be used to solve numerically challenging problems that are
/// difficult to solve using double-precision arithmetic.
///
/// The implementation draws ideas from `a paper by S.I. Filip`_ to make the
/// algorithm robust against numerical errors. These ideas include the use of
/// Chebyshev proxy root finding to find the extrema of the weighted error function
/// in the Remez exchange step.

///
/// Parameters
/// ----------

/// can also be used as an anti-alias filter for interpolation. A way to define

/// parameter, which indicates what fraction of the output Nyquist frequency
/// range is not part of the filter passband, and thus not usable due to filter
/// roll-off and aliasing. Here is a generic function to design this type of
/// filter.

/// been quantized to fixed point. The way to design this kind of filter is by
/// using a linear slope function as the stopband weight. This is enabled by
/// setting `one_over_f=True` in this example function. Here we design a
/// decimate by 4 filter to illustrate the `1/f` decay bettery.
///
/// >>> design_antialias_lowpass(4, 0.2, 67, stopband_weight=10, one_over_f=True)
/// >>> plt.show()
///
/// A filter with a large number of taps is able to achieve a narrow transition
/// bandwidth with good stopband attenuation, and this is usually the reason why
/// a larger number of taps might be required in a filter. However, if a filter
/// with many taps is designed for a resonably large transition bandwidth, it is
/// able to achieve a very large stopband attenuation and passband
/// flatness. This makes the numerical problem ill-conditioned. pm-remez can
/// use the `num_bigfloat`_ library to solve this kinds of problems. For
/// example, here is a 512 tap filter with a transition bandwidth of 10% that
/// achieves almost -200 dB stopband attenuation. This kind of filter is rarely
/// useful in practice.
///
/// >>> design_antialias_lowpass(4, 0.1, 512, bigfloat=True)

///
/// **Polyphase filterbank prototype filters**
///
/// A particular kind of anti-alias lowpass filter is the prototype filter for a
/// polyphase filterbank (polyphase channelizer). These are filters for a decimation
/// factor equal to the number of channels, which is usually a relatively large
/// power of two when the polyphase filterbank is used for spectral analysis. The
/// number of taps is equal to an integer (usually small) times the number of channels.
///
/// The following example designs a prototype filter for a 2048 channel
/// polyphase filterbank with 6 taps per channel and a transition bandwidth of
/// 35%. A custom stopband weight and 1/f decay are used for best results. This
/// filter is close to the limits of what can be design with pm-remez without
/// running into numerical problems (even with `bigfloat=True`). Increasing the
/// number of channels to 4096, or increasing the stopband weight, will make the
/// algorithm fail.
///
/// A prototype filter for a certain number of channels can be turned into a
/// prototype filter for a larger number of channels with the same number of
/// taps per channel by interpolation of the prototype filter taps. The
/// resulting filter will not be optimal in the minimax sense, but it will be
/// close if the initial filter was designed for a large number of taps. This is
/// a practical way to design prototype filters for more than 2048 channels.

///
/// Here is a plot that shows the shape of the passband more clearly. The points

///
/// Bandpass filters are less common than lowpass filter, but they can also be
/// easily designed with the Parks-McClellan algorithm. The following example
/// designs a filter with two passbands, one with 0 dB of gain and another
/// passband with -10 dB of gain. While the amplitude response of an optimal
/// lowpass filter in the transition band is always decreasing, bandpass filter
/// and other types of filters can have more complicated and sometimes

/// **CIC compensation filters**
///
/// CIC filters are rather popular for decimation and interpolation because they
/// do not require multipliers. The frequency response of an `M`-stage CIC
/// filter used for decimation by a factor of `D` is (normalized to unit gain)
///
/// .. math::
///     \left|\frac{\sin(\pi f D)}{D \sin(\pi f)}\right|^M.
///
/// On its own, a CIC filter is not so good as an anti-alias filter. The
/// passband is far from flat, and the stopband attenuation is not high enough.
/// For this reason, a CIC is usually followed by a FIR decimator with a small
/// decimation factor such as 2, 3, or 4. The FIR decimator limits the part of
/// the passband that is used to the flatter central region and attenuates the
/// regions of the spectrum where the CIC stopband is worst.
///
/// Sometimes, this FIR decimator is designed as a CIC compensation filter, by
/// having a passband response that is equal to the inverse of the CIC filter
/// response. In this way, the passband of the combined filter is flattened.
///
/// Compensation filters can be designed with pm-remez by using a Python
/// function or lambda to define the desired passband response. The following
/// example is a general function to design and plot CIC compensation filters.

/// Another attractive characteristic of CIC filters is that the same CIC filter

/// The `design_cic_compensation` example has a parameter

/// frequently.
///
/// The `design_cic_compensation` function has a parameter
/// `cic_decimation_for_compensation` that can be used to force the compensation

/// **Hilbert filters**
///
/// Different sources in the signal processing literature use the term Hilbert
/// filter to refer to different, but related, types of FIR filters. Some
/// sources (including most sources which speak of Hilbert filters in the
/// context of the Parks-McClellan algorithm) call Hilbert filter to a FIR
/// filter that tries to approximate the `Hilbert transform`_. The frequency
/// response of such an ideal Hilbert filter is :math:`-i` for :math:`f > 0` and
/// :math:`i` for :math:`f < 0`. Therefore, the filter shifts the phase of a
/// signal backwards or forwards by 90 degrees according to whether the
/// frequency of the signal is positive or negative respectively.
///
/// Such an ideal Hilbert filter cannot be realized as a FIR filter, because the
/// frequency response is not continous among other reasons. FIR filters with
/// real coefficients, odd symmetry, and an odd number of taps have a frequency
/// response which is a purely imaginary odd function. Therefore, an all-pass
/// FIR filter with those properties that has an amplitude response close to one
/// for all frequencies except near zero and the Nyquist frequency is a good
/// approximation of a Hilbert filter (the sign of all the FIR taps might need
/// to be flipped to make the imaginary part of the frequency response positive
/// for negative frequencies).
///
/// Other sources in the literature use the term Hilbert filter to refer to what
/// in mathematics is called the Riesz projection. The Riesz projection is an
/// ideal filter whose frequency response is one for :math:`f > 0` and zero for
/// :math:`f < 0`. Such a filter acts as an all-pass filter for signals of
/// positive frequencies and removes all the signals of negative
/// frequencies. This filter is often used in the context of transforming a real
/// signal into a complex signal, since the filter removes the negative
/// frequency (mirrored) part of the spectrum of the real signal. An example of
/// this application is the `GNU Radio Hilbert block`_.
///
/// The Hilbert transform and the Riesz projection are closely related. If we
/// denote by :math:`H` the Hilbert transform and by :math:`P` the Riesz
/// projection, we see that :math:`P = (I + iH) / 2`, where :math:`I` denotes
/// the identity transformation. A FIR filter with complex-valued taps that
